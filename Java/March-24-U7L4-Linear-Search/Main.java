U7L4 - Linear Search

Lesson Intro: This lesson covers the linear search algorithm, which was actually coded earlier in the course; today weâ€™ll review it, and then compare it with other searching and sorting algorithms.

Lesson Objectives:
 + Review the steps in the Linear Search algorithm
 + Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using the linear search algorithm to find data in an array or ArrayList
